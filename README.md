As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer with extensive experience in Agile processes and a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, my expertise lies in software development. I have a wealth of knowledge in both relational (MySQL, Postgres) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases, as well as React JS, React Native, Node JS, Laravel, GraphQl, NextJS, Vanilla JS, and Java. My proficiency with RESTful APIs, CMSs such as WordPress and Drupal, graphic design, and wireframing allows me to provide my clients with the best possible results.

Throughout my career, I have played an instrumental role in converting concepts into reality. My philosophy is that every problem requires a unique solution, and this mindset has contributed to my success and the success of my teams. If you have an idea that you want to convert into a web or mobile app, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me. I am confident that my expertise and experience will help you achieve your goals and bring your ideas to life.
